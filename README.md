#turnout by county, percentage of total votes from each county, and county with the highest voter turnout.

# -38,855 voters from Jefferson County turned out to vote

# - 24,801 voters from Arapahoe County turned out to vote.
#Of the total 369,711 votes:
#10.5% came frome Jefferson County voters
#82.8% came from Denver County voters
#6.7% came from Arapahoe County voters
#The largest turnout of voters by county came from Denver County.


#Election Audit Summary

#The audit shows that Denver County had the highest voter turnout in this election.  In future election audits, it is recommended that the voter turnout also be 
#considered proportionally to each county's total population.  This could be achieved by defining additional keys for the counties)?). This application would offer 
#clarity to the 2-dimensional voter turnout. 
#The percentage of votes by county for non-winning candidates is also recommended in future election audits as it could reveal the need for county 
#reapportionment or redistricting. The code for these calculations would be executed to the print file after the voter turnout totals to provide an additional layer of 
#detail in the negative space for the commission to evaluate overall success and transparency for the election data audit.
